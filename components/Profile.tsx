                    I&apos;m a student at Florida International University, majoring in computer science. During college I hope to find 
                    an (<small>paidü§û</small>) internship to increase my skills in web development and pay rent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Technologies I am familiar with and use in my projects are TypeScript, React, Next.js, and MongoDB. I have also used Python and Java.
                    I enjoy the design and development process of creating a website, specifically the aspect of making each project highly accessible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I enjoy watching movies, sports, and traveling. Among places I have been my favorites
                    have been New York City and The Balkans. I&apos;m planning a trip to Spain‚úàÔ∏è for after I graduate, while I learn Spanish/Catalan.
