                <p>I enjoy making cool things for the internet, [insert streaming service here] and chill, and using expensive software 
                like Adobe Creative Suite for my other hobbies.</p>
                
                <p>I am a student at Florida International University, majoring in computer science. During college I hope to find 
                an (<small>paidðŸ¤ž</small>) internship to increase my skills in web development and pay rent.</p>

                <p>I have mostly worked with JavaScript and TypeScript. Other technologies I use include React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, 
                along with a little Java.</p>
